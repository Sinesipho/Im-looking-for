				<h2>Business Collaboration</h2>
				<article>
					Collaboration has far-reaching implications for the enterprise-wide culture of an organization. Collaboration, as contrasted to the more circumscribed concept of teamwork, cuts across organizations, divisions, departments and working groups. It also involves more than just cooperation; it requires the ability and willingness to creatively share ideas and knowledge and to create new knowledge with others. And this is the crux of the problem, because it is hard for individuals to do this when they still believe that "knowledge is power" and they hoard their knowledge."

				<h2>Business fundings</h2>
				<article>
					<b>1. Know your platform and the companies that match it.</b> Companies are interested in reaching audiences they typically do not have at their fingertips. It’s less expensive than purchasing traditional media advertising and helps them target these individuals through an intermediary that already has their attention and trust. <br>
					<b>2. Offer Value. Sponsorships come in many forms, including:</b>
						<ul>
						<li>Sponsored posts from the corporation on your blog</li>
						<li>Giveaways of their products to your audience</li>
						<li>Product reviews</li>
						<li>Advertising</li>
						<li>Events</li>
						</ul><br>
					<b>3. Write a compelling proposal that makes it clear why a corporation should sponsor your business.</b>You want to write a story about you or your business that is exciting and meaningful. Don’t simply state what you sell; explain why you impact lives. Remember, sponsorships are not just about your business: the company you want to partner with will want to know what’s in it for them. How will the company reap benefits it wouldn’t otherwise get?<br>

				<h2>Business Loans</h2>
				<!-- <p>need capital for your business and  don't know where to go? worry no more because we got the right banks for you!</p><br> -->
				<article>
					Several of South Africa’s national banks are involved in encouraging and supporting entrepreneurial activity.</br>
				Like government funding though, banks have conditions that need to be met before lending occurs in order to lessen their risk in financing your business.</br>
				<ul>
					<li>Start by ensuring your house is in order. Make sure you have comprehensive records and documentation that shows your business has been profitable for a period of time, that your credit record is clean, and that you have collateral to borrow against.</li>
					<li>Make sure you have a sound business plan that you have written and understand, complete with financial records and projections to discuss with the bank.</li>
					<li>Have your financial statements ready, be able to detail how much money is needed and for what purpose, and foster a good track record with your bank before asking for a loan. If you’re in a good position to get a loan, shop around to see which bank can offer you the best loan terms.</li>
				</ul>
